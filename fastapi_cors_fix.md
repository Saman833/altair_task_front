# FastAPI CORS Fix

## Problem
Your FastAPI backend is missing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration, which is causing the browser to block requests from your frontend.

## Solution
Add CORS middleware to your FastAPI application.

### Step 1: Update your main FastAPI file

Add this to your main FastAPI application file (usually `main.py` or `app.py`):

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from your_routers import router  # Import your existing router
frontendURL=proccess.env.FRONT_URL
app = FastAPI()
# Add CORS middleware BEFORE including routers
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        frontendURL,  # Your frontend URL
        "http://localhost:3000",  # For local development
        "http://localhost:3001",  # Alternative local port
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  # Allow all methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
    allow_headers=["*"],  # Allow all headers
)

# Include your existing router
app.include_router(router)
```

### Step 2: Alternative - Allow all origins (for development)

If you want to allow all origins (less secure but easier for development):

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Allow all origins
    allow_credentials=False,  # Must be False when allow_origins=["*"]
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### Step 3: Redeploy your backend

After making these changes:
1. Commit and push your changes
2. Redeploy your backend on Railway
3. Test the connection again

## Expected Result

After adding CORS middleware, your frontend should be able to make direct requests to your backend without CORS errors.

## Testing

1. Visit `/test` on your frontend
2. Both server-side and client-side tests should pass
3. Your main application should work without the proxy

## Note

The proxy solution I implemented earlier will still work as a fallback, but with proper CORS configuration, you can make direct requests to your backend.
